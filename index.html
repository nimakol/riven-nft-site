    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Riven’s Tale — The Spirit of the Forest<br>
    <strong>Genre:</strong> Dark Fantasy<br>
    <strong>Chapters:</strong> 8 (Each tied to a visual NFT scene)</p>

    <hr><h3>Chapter 1: Born in Mist</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">In the heart of an ancient enchanted forest, under the pale glow of a full moon, a being unlike any other was born. His fur shimmered in the moonlight, and his amber eyes burned with quiet fire. Riven — part fox, part man — emerged not from a mother’s womb, but from the forest’s magic itself. Spirits whispered his name through the trees, as if they had awaited his coming for centuries. Wrapped in silence and silver mist, his journey had only just begun.</p>

    <hr><h3>Chapter 2: The Cursed Village</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">Days passed as Riven wandered deeper into the forest until he stumbled upon a forgotten village swallowed by shadows. The homes stood in eerie silence, crooked and decaying, shrouded in a dark mist that refused to lift. Strange figures lingered at the edge of his vision — ghosts or memories, he couldn’t tell. Something ancient and broken lay buried here. Riven felt it in his bones. The curse was alive, and it was watching him.</p>

    <hr><h3>Chapter 3: The Owl of Secrets</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">As night fell, a warm glow drew Riven to a fire deep in the woods. Perched beside it was an enormous owl draped in robes, eyes glowing like twin stars. The owl spoke in riddles and truths, calling Riven “the Child of Balance.” He revealed that the curse was tied to Riven’s own blood — and that only he could break it. “You are not alone,” the owl said. “But you are the first in centuries to listen.”</p>

    <hr><h3>Chapter 4: The Gift of Power</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">In a sacred clearing, beneath stars that seemed to pulse with magic, the owl offered Riven a pendant — shaped like a fox’s paw, glowing softly with golden light. As Riven reached for it, the pendant floated into his hand, merging with his spirit. A surge of power raced through him, ancient and wild. The trees rustled in approval. Riven was no longer a mere traveler. He had been chosen.</p>

    <hr><h3>Chapter 5: The Path of Light</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">With the pendant pulsing on his chest, Riven pressed forward into the forest. Dawn broke as the trees parted before him, guiding him with quiet reverence. Symbols lit up beneath his feet. The air shimmered with unseen magic. He was no longer afraid. The forest itself had accepted him, and the path to destiny was clear — though not without danger.</p>

    <hr><h3>Chapter 6: The Beast of Shadows</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">From the depths of the woods rose a creature twisted by darkness — roots, smoke, and fury woven into a monstrous form. It struck without mercy, a guardian of the curse. Riven fought with all he had, the pendant blazing with light as it countered the shadow’s rage. The clash shook the trees and scattered embers into the night. He did not fall. He stood firm. And when the beast vanished into ash, Riven knew: he was stronger than the darkness.</p>

    <hr><h3>Chapter 7: The Mirror of Fate</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">Hidden behind vines and stone, an ancient temple awaited. Inside, floating in the air, was a mirror older than time. As Riven approached, it awakened — and within its reflection, he saw himself as he had never imagined: clad in glowing armor, powerful, fearless, and surrounded by fire and light. It was not a prophecy. It was a promise. And it filled him with purpose.</p>

    <hr><h3>Chapter 8: The Return</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">When Riven returned to the cursed village, the shadows recoiled. The mist lifted, and the spirits of the forest rose to the skies in peace. Freed villagers stepped out from their hiding places, eyes wide with awe and tears. Riven, now a guardian of balance, stood in silence as sunlight spilled across the trees. The forest was no longer silent. It sang his name.</p>
